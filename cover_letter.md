Dear Judy,

Thank you helping me to connect with researchers at Geisinger. I'm a scientific programmer who has developed software for the web to help unravel the genotype and phenotype of autism. I'm recent to the area and am looking for opportunities to contribute to the work here at Geisinger.

My expertise is broad and well suited to a senior developer role in a research environment. In addition to architecting software and systems for autism research, I have experience mentoring lab members and teaching in a more formal capacity. I take pride not only in my own work, but also in helping to build a mutually supportive team.

Thanks again, and please let me know if you have any further questions regarding my qualifications and interests.

--Tristan
